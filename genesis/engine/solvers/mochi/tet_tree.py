"""Bounding-box hierarchy over the collider tetrahedra of the deformable solids.

A sample point in contact with a deformable solid lies inside one of its deformed tetrahedra, so the contact query is a
point location. The hierarchy is built once over the rest shape (the topology never changes) and its boxes are refit to
the deformed vertices at every assembly, the way mochi refits the hierarchy of its tetrahedral maps; a query descends
from the root and visits only the nodes whose box contains the point, a few dozen node tests for thousands of
tetrahedra, where a uniform hash over a fine mesh walks chains of hundreds of entries near the body.

Nodes are stored in depth-first order with an escape index, so that a kernel traverses the tree with a single loop and
no stack (see sample_tree.py): the children of an inner node `i` are `i + 1` and `escape[i + 1]`. The refit runs level
by level from the deepest nodes to the root (a level's boxes only depend on the level below), so the nodes are also
listed by depth.
