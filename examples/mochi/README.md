# MochiSolver examples

The `MochiSolver` is a port of the implicit multi-physics solver of Meta's mochi physics engine
(https://github.com/facebookresearch/project_superdex, Apache-2.0). Every substep solves one nonlinear system in which
the inertia of all bodies and a smooth signed-distance penalty contact model are assembled together, so large time
steps (10-25 ms) remain stable, and contact needs no coupler.

Entities are added with `gs.materials.Mochi.Rigid(...)`; solver options live in `gs.options.MochiOptions`. Double
precision (`gs.init(precision="64")`) is recommended: the default contact stiffness of 1e9 Pa/m makes the Newton system
ill-conditioned in single precision.

Contact parameters (per material, combined per pair by geometric mean):

| parameter | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `penalty_coefficient` | 1e9 Pa/m | contact pressure per unit penetration once the ramp is fully active |
| `penalty_threshold` | 1 mm | signed distance at which pressure starts to build |
| `penalty_smoothing_half_distance` | 5 mm | half-width of the smooth pressure ramp (full ramp 10 mm) |
| `friction` | 0.5 | Coulomb friction coefficient |
| `friction_falloff_vel` | 0.01 m/s | sliding speed below which friction is regularized |
| `normal_viscous_damping` | 0 s/m | impact damping; the coefficient of restitution e at impact speed v follows from `c = (1-e)(1+4.5e)/(e(1+8e/3))/v` |

Supported in this stage: free rigid bodies and fixed bodies, plane/sphere/box analytic colliders and grid colliders for
meshes, backward Euler and BDF2 time integration. Articulated and deformable bodies are the next stages.
